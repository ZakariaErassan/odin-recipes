    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 bone-in chicken thighs</li>
        <li>kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons paprika</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons ground turmeric</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 lemon, zested and juiced</li>
        <li>olive oil, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon canola oil, or to taste </li>
        <li>½ white onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup pimento-stuffed green olives</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li> 
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper. Let come to room temperature, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine chicken broth, paprika, cumin, ginger, turmeric, cinnamon, and 2 teaspoons lemon zest in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat oils in a cast iron skillet until they begin to smoke. Add chicken thighs, skin-side down, and cook for 4 minutes. Flip thighs and continue cooking until skin is crispy, about 4 minutes more. Transfer to a plate. Saute onion in the skillet until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour chicken broth mixture carefully over onion; scrape up any browned bits off the bottom of the skillet.</li>
        <li>Return chicken thighs to the skillet. Spoon some of the liquid over the thighs.</li>
        <li>Transfer skillet to the preheated oven; bake until chicken thighs are no longer pink in the center, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add olives to the skillet. Drizzle lemon juice over the thighs and garnish the whole dish with parsley.</li>
    </ol>
